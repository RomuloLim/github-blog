                Programming languages all have built-in data structures, but these often differ from one language to another. This article attempts to list the built-in data structures available in JavaScript and what properties they have. These can be used to build other data structures. Wherever possible, comparisons with other languages are drawn.
                Dynamic typing means that a variable in JavaScript can hold a value of any data type. Data types in JavaScript can be divided into two categories: primitive and reference.
